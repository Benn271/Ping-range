# Ping-range
Ping  all Ip addresses in a range.

This was created to give you ip adresses that are alive so you can run furter scans like nmap. It will get most if not all ip adresses that are up in the range given.

# Features
* Given a range of ip addresses where the last octet is the only octet changed, it will ping all of them. This   is to see all alive hosts.
* Shows the ping results in terminal
  # V2 Features
  * Supports any octet change
  * Uses threading for faster results
  # Later Versions
  * Output to a file that is specified
  * GUI
